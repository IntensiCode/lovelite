- Font files must be loaded from `assets/fonts/`
- Sound files must be loaded from `assets/sounds/`
- Image files must be loaded from `assets/images/`

## Module Paths
- Local modules must be required using the `src.` prefix (e.g., `require("src.base.vector2")`)
- External libraries must be required from `src.libraries` (e.g., `require("src.libraries.sti.init")`)

## Constants
- Game constants should be defined in their respective modules
- Shared constants should be defined in `src.base.constants`
- Map-related constants should be defined in `src.map_manager`

## Configuration Values
- Default map: `level1.lua`
- Default tile size: 16x16 pixels
- Default player start position: Defined in map file with property `kind="player"`

## Validation
When loading resources:
1. Always verify file existence before loading
2. Use exact paths as defined in this configuration
3. Include error messages that reference these rules when paths are incorrect

# Code Rules

## Refactoring
- Refactorings should never change behavior. The functionality of the code must remain exactly the same before and after a refactoring.
- The purpose of refactoring is to improve code structure, readability, or maintainability, not to modify what the code does.
- When adding or modifying functions:
  - Add type annotations for all parameters and return values
  - Update all callsites to match the new type signatures
  - Use descriptive type names (e.g., `PlayerSetup` instead of just `table`)
  - Make sure and/or change names to use snake_case instead of camelCase and update callsites appropriately

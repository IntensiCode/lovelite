# Path Rules

## Library Paths
- STI library path must be `src/libraries/sti.init`
- This is the correct path that was previously fixed and should not be changed to `libs.sti` or any other variation

## Map Paths
- Map file path must be `assets/maps/level1.lua`
- This is the correct path that was previously fixed and should not be changed to `test_map.lua` or any other variation

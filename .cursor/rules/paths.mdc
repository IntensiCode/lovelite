# Path Rules

## Module Paths
- Local modules must be required using the `src.` prefix (e.g., `require("src.base.pos")`)

## Library Paths
- STI library path must be `src/libraries/sti.init`
- This is the correct path that was previously fixed and should not be changed to `libs.sti` or any other variation

## Constants
- Game constants should be defined in their respective modules
- Shared constants should be defined in `src.base.constants`

## Map Paths
- Map file path must be `assets/maps/level1.lua`
- This is the correct path that was previously fixed and should not be changed to `test_map.lua` or any other variation
